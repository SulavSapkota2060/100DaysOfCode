# Day 1 of #100DaysOfCode


Finally! I am taking on this challenge. After almost a year of not learning new technologies and being stuck on the old ones, I felt a need to level up the skills I possessed. Although I'm a professional web developer, I was just not content with the skills I had. As a matter of fact, The skills I possessed were minimal and ground level. Now, I believe, is the right time to learn something new and interesting. And, most importantly, try to be better than I was yesterday. \n\n

So, I took on this challenge with a lot of doubts, and I do have a lot of doubts even when typing this. Will I be able to finish this? Will be able to work daily on this? and a million other questions. But I won't get the answer until I **actually take on the challenge.** 

So, here we are! **DAY 1**

### Topics I covered:
I worked primarily on my **Java** skills. I began programming journey by learning Java. After almost 4 years, getting back to Java was honestly nostalgic and wholesome. \n\n 

The code files are uploaded on the same folder. I played around with basic loops, functions, and conditionals. Nothing special, nothing fancy. Just a way to get back in. 

\n\n That's it!

*I'll be adding more details in the days to come when I actually start doing some DSA stuffs.*
